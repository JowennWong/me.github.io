Hi, I am Wong Jo Wenn also called myself CodeSnake, and I am a student at Crescendo International College studying computer science, I have been studying computer science for nearly a year now and I am currently trying to build my foundation skills in Apps and Game Development while also doing IoT and robotics as my hobby projects. Currently I don’t have a selected specialized course yet, I wasn’t eager to pursue any courses yet. In my opinion, I will be pursuing to work as a data scientist or an application or game developer. I’m best at communication through writing on email or chatting media, I enjoy deep understanding of asked problems before sharing my solutions.
