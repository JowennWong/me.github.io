A <font size=6><strong><i>shepherd</i></strong></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun
</p>
<br>
<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came runningfor help but didn't find any wolf.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The boy laugh and replied, "It was just fun, There is no wolf here". <font size=6><strong><i>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</i></strong></font>
</p>
<br>
<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs, the boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!!"</strike>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<font size=6 color=purple>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</font> So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
